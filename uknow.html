        <p><em>For some reason most people seem to be born without the part of the brain that understands
                pointers. This is an aptitude thing, not a skill thing – it requires a complex form of
                doubly-indirected <strong>thinking</strong> that some people just can’t do.</em> -

        <p>Hot and trending languages (since 2018) like Golang and Rust are becoming popular for various
            reasons. Both use and implement pointer concepts.</p>

            <li>“For beginners, this may slightly be difficult to learn because Go relies heavily on
                pointers which may not be easy to grasp as a new programmer.” — @timcodestoo <a

        <p>One of the most practical use cases for pointers</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three concepts - Functions from Unit_3(<code>fread</code>, <code>fwrite</code>, etc),
                structures from Unit_4 (<a href="http://j.mp/opaqueC">opaque</a> <code>FILE</code> typedef
                for<code>struct _iobuf</code>) and pointers from Unit_3 (FILE *) come together to accomplish
                file processing (<a href="http://j.mp/unit5Easy">Unit_5</a>)</li>

                write up a C code for the challenge?</li>
